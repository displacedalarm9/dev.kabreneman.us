# Repository Audit and Remediation Protocol

## Purpose

This document defines the comprehensive audit and remediation protocol for the kabreneman project ecosystem. Use this protocol for quarterly repository audits, security reviews, and remediation planning.

## References

[See: README.md for repository structure]
[See: https://github.com/displacedalarm9/kabreneman.us/blob/main/docs/filename.md for naming conventions]
[See: https://github.com/displacedalarm9/kabreneman.us/tree/main/procedures for related procedures]

> **Note:** This repository (KABDMSV2) is in transition. The current README describes it as the "management system," but the planned state per this audit is for KABDMSV2 to become the data storage repository (data.kabreneman.us), while kabreneman.us becomes the file management system.

## Trigger Conditions

Execute this protocol when:

- [ ] Quarterly audit schedule (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
- [ ] New repository added to ecosystem.
- [ ] Security incident or vulnerability discovered.
- [ ] Major structural changes proposed.
- [ ] Repository purpose or scope changes.

---

## Repository Ecosystem Overview

### Planned State

| Repository | Purpose | Visibility | Status |
|------------|---------|------------|--------|
| **kabreneman.us** | File management system (software) | Public | Active |
| **data.kabreneman.us** | Data storage (actual files) | Private | Planned (currently KABDMSV2) |
| **dev.kabreneman.us** | Development playground | Public/Private | Needs decision |

### Current State

| Repository | Current Name | Current Purpose | Transition Needed |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| kabreneman.us | kabreneman.us | Active with scripts, docs, procedures | Clarify as software repo |
| KABDMSV2 | KABDMSV2 | Management system (per README) | Rename to data.kabreneman.us, set private |
| dev.kabreneman.us | dev.kabreneman.us | Empty since Dec 2020 | Archive or repurpose |
